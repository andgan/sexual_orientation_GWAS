This repository contains three folders: 

* /data: contains the data need it to reproduce the figures 
* /pgm: contains the program to reproduce the figures, one for each figure
* /fig: contains the output created by running the content of /pgm. Notice that we report each panel in a figure as separate file. The panels where then combined and in cases post-processed using photoshop.


_Notice:_ 

1) To reproduce Figure 1, access to individual-level UK Biobank data is need it. We provide the variable names, but not the individual level data.
2) We cannot reproduce figure 2, panel A because we are not allowed by 23andMe to share more than 10K SNPs. We provided the code to do that based on the summary statistics from just UK Biobank.
